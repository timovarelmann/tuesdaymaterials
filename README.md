After succesful login to JupyterHub, copy this URL, paste it into the current tab of your browser address bar, and execute. This will automatically run a GitHub pull command to synchronise the contents of the Jupyter folder "tuesdaymaterials" to the repository I created.

Please copy or cut all course material you need and paste it into another directory of Jupyter. Don't work within "tuesdaymaterials"!  All your personal changes to existing files or new files within that folder will be deleted when synchronising the folder again.

Running the command for the first time will create the folder "tuesdaymaterials" in your Jupyter home directory.
